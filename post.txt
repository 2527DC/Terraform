🚀 Why Terraform Workspaces Matter in Real-World Projects

In real production setups, we rarely build separate Terraform projects for dev, test, staging, and production.
Instead, we design Terraform at a module level so the same codebase can be reused by the entire team.
At first, using multiple *.tfvars files (dev.tfvars, test.tfvars, prod.tfvars) feels sufficient.
But here’s the catch 👇
Terraform tracks infrastructure using a state file.
If you switch only the variable file and run terraform apply, Terraform will update or overwrite the same infrastructure, because the state is still shared.

This makes it impossible to keep environments truly isolated.
Workspaces allow us to:
    Use one single Terraform project
    Keep separate state files for each environment
    Preserve dev, test, and production infrastructures independently
    Avoid maintaining duplicate Terraform code
    By combining workspaces + environment-specific tfvars, teams can safely manage multiple environments without code duplication or state conflicts.

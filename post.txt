### Terraform State & Locking – One of the MOST important topics in Infrastructure as Code 🚀

Many teams start using Terraform, but production issues usually come from misunderstanding the STATE.

Here are some key learnings from real-world Terraform usage:

• Terraform state is the single source of truth for your infrastructure
• Losing the state file can cause duplicate resources or outages
• Local state works for learning, but NEVER for teams or production
• Remote state enables collaboration, safety, and consistency

Why S3 + DynamoDB is a powerful combo:

S3:

* Stores the Terraform state file securely
* Supports versioning for rollback
* Encrypted at rest

DynamoDB:

* Handles state locking
* Prevents concurrent terraform apply
* Uses atomic writes to avoid race conditions

State locking ensures:

* Only one apply runs at a time
* No state corruption
* No unexpected infra changes

Common production issues to watch out for:

* Stuck locks due to Ctrl+C or crashes
* State drift from manual changes
* Sensitive data stored in state
* Editing state manually without understanding impact

Golden rule:
Infrastructure should be treated like code, but the STATE should be treated like GOLD.

Remote state + locking is NOT optional for production.

If you’re working with Terraform in a team, this setup will save you from some very painful outages.
